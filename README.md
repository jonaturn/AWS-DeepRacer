Here's my team's approach to the AWS Deepracer Hackathon organized by NUS IEEE.

-We first calculated the optimal racing line, the worksheet can be found here: https://github.com/jonaturn/AWS-DeepRacer/blob/d6a1bb2d98cc8ac3e77ec51388e5e0f22eb8a3d4/aws_deepracer_nus_hackathon/Part1_Race-Line-Calculation.ipynb

-We then calculated the optimal speed, more information at: https://github.com/jonaturn/AWS-DeepRacer/blob/d6a1bb2d98cc8ac3e77ec51388e5e0f22eb8a3d4/aws_deepracer_nus_hackathon/Part2_RaceLine_Speed_ActionSpace.ipynb

-And lastly our modified reward function for our model: https://github.com/jonaturn/AWS-DeepRacer/blob/d6a1bb2d98cc8ac3e77ec51388e5e0f22eb8a3d4/aws_deepracer_nus_hackathon/reward_function.py
